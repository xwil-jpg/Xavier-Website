    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy spending my free time playing basketball and video games. Basketball helps me stay active, focused, and competitive—it’s a great way to push myself and connect with friends. I like the teamwork and strategy that go into every game, whether I’m playing in real life or watching the pros. Video games give me a different kind of challenge, where I can relax, think creatively, and test my skills. Both basketball and gaming let me express myself, have fun, and keep improving at something I love doing.</p>
